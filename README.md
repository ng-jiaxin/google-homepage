<h1>Recreating Google's Homepage</h1>
This is my first project in The Odin Project. It is best viewed on Mozilla Firefox.

<h2>Takeaways</h2>
- Utilising division element in html.
- Creating forms, navigation bars, and styling them accordingly.
- Distinguishing between relative and absolute positioning to place an image at the desired position.

<h2>Possible Expansions</h2>
- Making a functional search bar.
- Making it responsive to various screen sizes.
